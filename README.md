# README for Project1a

When inputing the commands the full name of the input and output file have to be written.
For Example
java weiwilli_CSCI301_Project1a.SearchMap C:\Users\wwei7\eclipse-workspace2\Project1a\bin\weiwilli_CSCI301_Project1a\input.txt C:\Users\wwei7\eclipse-workspace2\Project1a\bin\weiwilli_CSCI301_Project1a\output.txt

There is no test cases for SearchMap as the class only contains a main function.
